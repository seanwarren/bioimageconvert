= Version Change Log =

== 2.1.0 ==

 * Fix: Several important fixes for SLIC superpixels, ROIs, fuse...

== 2.0.9 ==
 This is an intermediate release towards version 3, these will be the features of the final v3 release.

 * New: Added support for new formats
        * JPEG-XR using jxrlib 1.1
        * WebP using libwebp 0.4
        * JPEG-2000 using openjpeg 2.1.0, work with Mario Emmenlauer (will be updated to optimized GROK distro for v3)
        * NIFTI-1 using niftilib
        * ITK MediaHeader RAW
        * NRRD RAW
 * New: major rewrite of metadata handling with extended support (JPEG, JPEG-XR, JPEG-2000, TIFF, PNG, WebP)
        * GeoTIFF
        * ICC
        * EXIF
        * IPTC
        * XMP
 * New: Added tile-based ROI interface
 * New: Added full support for color spaces, profiles and conversions using LCMS2
 * New: Added support for RGBA imagery:
        * metadata based fusion will ignore alpha channel
        * default alpha mapping to false color image is set to transarent
        * image mode is reported in the metadata and properly indicates RGBA for most formats
        ** TIFF format is one exception due to inability of defining an alpha channel reliably via photometric tag
           and since tiff is mostly used to transmit false color images the alpha channel can not be automatically detected
 * Update: DCRAW updated libraw to 0.18 and supported Canon 5DSr camera CR2 files
 * Update: TIFF added compressions: jpeg, zip, lzma
 * Update: OME-TIFF added preferred color support
 * Update: Metaxpress improved metadata parsing
 * Update: optimizated openmp based parallelization, ignoring small images

== 2.0 ==

 * New: All command line operations are now ordered and thus may render different results to version 1.X

        Supported formats:
          TIFF pyramids in two variuants: with top level pages with low-res images as well as low res stored in sub-ifds
          OME-TIFF files support only sub-ifd storage in order to keep compatibility

 * Fix: Report errors when tile could not be created due to unreadable format
 * Fix: Removed error during PNG reading due to incorrect color space

== 1.66 ==

 * New: Decoding of preferred RGB components for each channel for all formats
 * Updated: Zeiss LSM parser improved to decode more meatdata
 * Updated: More information is printed about formats in XML

== 1.53 ==
 * New: Full support for OME-BigTIFF
